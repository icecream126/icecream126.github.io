## About Me

I'm a M.S.-Ph.D. integrated course student at POSTECH [Machine Learning Lab](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/) advised by Prof. [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home).  My main research areas include implicit neural representations, geometric deep learning, and (3D) Graph neural networks.

I'm always eager to connect with researchers in the fields of artificial intelligence. Feel free to reach out for discussions, collaborations, or just to share interesting ideas.
